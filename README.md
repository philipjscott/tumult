Yet another **Javascript noise library**. Demonstrations [here](http://philipjscott.github.io/tumult). Currently supports Perlin noise for any arbitrary dimension and Simplex[1-2]. Eventually might support:
* Simplex[3-4]

## Installation

```sh
npm install tumult --save
```

The built files are also available on `unpkg` and `jsdelivr`:


```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tumult"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tumult"></script>
```

## Usage

```js
const tumult = require('tumult')

const simplex2 = new tumult.Simplex2('some_seed')

for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
  for (let y = 0; y < 10; y++) {
    console.log(simplex2.gen(x / 64, y / 64))
  }
}
```

## API

### tumult

Object that stores noise constructors. Below is the full list of constructors:

* **tumult.Simplex1**
* **tumult.Simplex2**
* **tumult.Perlin1**
* **tumult.Perlin2**
* **tumult.Perlin3**
* **tumult.Perlin4**
* **tumult.PerlinN**

Every constructor has the following signature:

#### tumult.NoiseConstructor([seed])

Returns a `noise` object.

#### seed

Type: `String | Number`

Seed to use for shuffling the permutation look-up table. If no value is passed, `Math.random()` will be used as a seed.

### noise

Noise object returned from invoke a noise constructor; all noise objects have the same API:

#### noise.seed([seed])

Re-seeds the permutation look-up table. If a number is passed, it will be converted to a string which will seed the generator. If no string is passed, `.seed()` defaults to using `Math.random()`

#### noise.gen(x, y, z...)

Generates a noise value given the appropriate dimensions (eg. a simplex2 generator should take two arguments, a perlin3 generator should take three arguments, etc.)

#### noise.octavate(octaves, x, y, z...)

Applies [fractal Brownian motion](https://thebookofshaders.com/13/), summing iterations of the noise (# of iterations = `octaves`). With each successive iteration, the frequency is doubled and the weight is halved. 

Note that the generator created by `tumult.PerlinN` is variadic, meaning you can get Nth dimensional perlin noise by passing N arguments. Note that the gradient lookup table for `perlinN` isn't optimised, so calling `perlinN(x, y)` will likely produce less "attractive" noise than `perlin2(x, y)`.

For quickly displaying heightmaps, I highly recommend using [terrapaint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terrapaint).

~~**noise.transform(fn)**~~

**Consider wrapping your function instead:**

```js
const tumult = require('tumult')

const simplex2 = new tumult.Simplex2()
const transform = (x, y) => Math.sin(1 / simplex2(x, y))
```

Takes in a function which will its `this` bound to noiseGenerator object, meaning you can call `gen` and `octavate` using `this.gen`, etc. This function should take in the dimensions as parameters, and return a value. `.transform` will return the new transformed noise function. For example, suppose you want a function which will return `sin(1/noise(x/32,y/32))`, you can do the following:

```js
const tumult = require('tumult')

const simplex2 = new tumult.Simplex2('seed')
const noise = simplex2.transform(function (x, y) {
  return Math.sin(1 / this.gen(x/32, y/32))
})

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
    console.log(noise(i, j))
  }
}
```

TL;DR, `noise.transform` is essentially a helper function that lets you wrap the noise function with your own function.

## Note on testing

Currently the tests only verify trivial test requirements (eg. presence of methods, checking if output is within expected [-1, 1] bound); a better way to test this library would be to utilize OpenCV to verify the noise produced is correct, outlined here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32023240/how-to-write-unit-tests-for-a-perlin-noise-library

Unfortunately I'm lacking the bandwidth to implement this, but pull requests are welcome!
